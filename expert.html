            <h2>What Is Expert?</h2>
            <p>Expert connects users to vetted Experts so they can find solutions to their everyday problems. Through
                our
                low-cost platform, users can communicate with Experts across a variety of niches via text, image, or
                video
                chat, and can save their conversations to refer back to later.</p>

        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>The Expert App originated from the Problem statement that “Users need a way to seek out answer and advice
                from a variety of niches and industries, because they struggle to find reliable, instant, and applicable
                advice from experts within a variety of fields. We will know this to be true when we see users
                successfully finding the advice useful and applicable, and indicating via reviews that the advice they
                received was helpful.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
            <p>By creating a convenient and cost-effective app for users to connect with Experts, we will enable users
                to solve their immediate problems, fulfill task, and help eliminate stress in their daily lives.</p>

            <h2>User Research</h2>
            <p>My research for this app consisted of a competitive analysis to understand the needs of the market and
                niches that needed to be filled. User interviews helped me discover what they really needed in the realm
                of an advice app, as well as their needs and problems. Through the affinity mapping process I was able
                to pinpoint user’s behaviors, attitudes, frustrations, needs, and goals which proved helpful in bringing
                the Expert app to life.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>User Personas</h2>
            <p>I was able to empathize with the users in what they both lacked and desired in the realm of real-time,
                hands-on advice, so with that in mind, User Personas were created to help keep our design user-centered.

        <div>
            <h2>User Flows</h2>
            <p>
                Through these personas, I was able to establish the three primary tasks for our app to fulfill:

                The first was the ability to add and store a payment method so that users could quickly and easily
                connect to an Expert hassle free.

                It was also apparent that having a video chat feature was vital to our users, especially if they were
                unfamiliar with terms or items, especially in the realm of home improvement. The video chat feature
                would eliminate errors and provide reliability to the user.

                And finally, the ability to create a track a to-do list directly in the app was a heavy need for the
                users. These lists were often spread across various apps in their phones, so having all of that in one
                place proved helpful.

        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Prototyping</h2>
            <p>With all of this in mind, I moved on to the initial prototyping phase creating some mid-fidelity
                prototypes of those three user-flows.</p>
                <div class="col-md-6">

        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>User-testing/Test Reporting</h2>
            <p>Upon the initial user-testing of the app, I gained a lot of helpful insight, especially upon condensing
                information into a Usability Test Report.

                For example, Users initially mentioned that they found the walkthrough to be wordy, boring and the
                design of it to be somewhat clunky.

                Users seemed to enjoy the video chat function of the app but recommended adding a way to filter through
                Experts even within the category to find the help they needed even faster.

                The easy-to-use list feature was a big hit with the users and they enjoyed that the layout mirrored so
                many other list apps that they were already familiar with.

                And users also appreciated the muted color palette because they felt the muted colors were calming and
                may even help reduce stress if they’re trying to find advice in difficult situations.

                Upon these discoveries, I set out to design a second iteration of these prototypes that would serve the
                user even better.</p>
                <div class="col-md-6">

            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Redesign</h2>
            <p>During the redesign process, I updated the walkthrough to be more interactive, more visually stimulating,
                and less wordy.

                One way I accomplished this was by giving users an A/B Preference test of two different walkthrough
                screens to see which color template they preferred which is how I ultimately ended up deciding which
                walkthrough screens to use.</p>
            <div class="col-md-6">
            <picture>
                <source srcset="./img/project_expert_images/expert-abtest-small.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
                <img src="./img/project_expert_images/expert-abtest-large.png" alt="Expert Redesign">
            </picture>
        </div>
            <p>The video chat prototype was also reiterated upon to include a feature to filter the Experts and have the
                chat prices listed so the users were informed before committing to a chat.

                At this point, I also sought out feedback from fellow designers and received many good suggestions.

                I redesigned features of the app such as banners, buttons, chat bubbles, and the text colors to bring
                cohesion to the app overall, and to comply with accessibility guidelines.</p>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <picture>
                <source srcset="./img/project_expert_images/chat_small.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
                <img src="./img/project_expert_images/chat_large.png" alt="Expert Redesign">
            </picture>
            
            <picture>
                <source srcset="./img/project_expert_images/payment_small.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
                <img src="./img/project_expert_images/payment_large.png" alt="Expert Redesign">
            </picture>
        </div>
        </div>
            <p>After a third round of usability tests it seems as though these prototypes were much more satisfying
                to users and their needs and goals. They were very happy with both the flow and the aesthetics of
                the app.

                Overall, I enjoyed the process of creating the Expert App. I am always fascinated by how crucial
                user feedback is and that assumptions we make to suit our needs as designers aren’t necessarily
                always true to what the user needs to reach their end goal.

                Throughout this process, I believe I ended up with a very functional and helpful app that achieved
                both user and business goals!</p>
